  <section><h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>It was supposed to be a quick project when I started in early 2023, but it took
me an entire year to finish it. There are many things that can go wrong when it
comes to electronic circuit design if you are not experienced. I have run
through multiple prototypes and bought a CNC machine to make things less
annoying, and documented my experience in a
<a href="/articles/manufacturing-pcb-at-home/">separate article</a>. Let's focus on the
<a href="https://circuitpython.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adafruit's CircuitPython runtime</a> itself.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous operation</h3>
<p>There are two main processes running, the scheduler and the menu, that need to
be run in parallel. CircuitPython does not support threads, interrupts or
concurrency by default, but a
<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_asyncio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first-party <code>asyncio</code> substitute</a>
is available.</p>
<p>However, some actions are performed synchronously, for example the opening and
closing itself. There is no guarantee that <code>await asyncio.sleep(1.0)</code> will take
exactly 1 second, while the blocking version, <code>time.sleep(1.0)</code>, will provide
good enough results. Asynchronous tasks are performed on some menu screens as
well.</p>
<h3>User menu</h3>
<p>Every menu screen inherits the <code>Menu</code> class, which represents the finite list of
editable variables in &quot;navigation&quot; or &quot;edit&quot; cursor mode. Implementations have
their own state and can change the behavior of every button or the displayed
text. For example, the <code>IdleMenu</code> shows the current time and device status but
has no visible cursor.</p>
<p>The display I have picked for this project does not have built-in backlight
control and can only show basic English or Japanese text and up to 8 custom
symbols. When user presses the button, the character set is dynamically updated.
The display's backlight can be controlled manually via simple transistor circuit
and a PWM signal.</p>
<p>CircuitPython can handle single buttons and key matrices via the built-in
<code>keypad</code> module. It does not report for how long the buttons have been pressed,
though. I have added this feature in order to reduce a number of keys.</p>
<h3>Persistence</h3>
<p>The AT24LC32 EEPROM chip is commonly found on cheap RTC + EEPROM modules and
provides 4kB of non-volatile memory. There is no file system, so I had to roll
out my own solution for storing settings and log entries.</p>
<p>Each block of data is 8 bytes long and includes the checksum (basic XOR). If the
read data is invalid, the settings are reset to the safe defaults. Up to 127 log
entries are stored and rotated, with EOF marker updated after every write.</p>
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<p>CircuitPython has good hardware support and a wide array of additional
libraries, but in reality, it is meant to be used for learning and prototyping.
I have decided to take the risk and use it for my always-on device.</p>
<p>RP2040 chip found in Raspberry Pi Pico has an internal watchdog timer that is
used to reboot the board if the program does not &quot;feed&quot; it for a specified
amount of time. Since the CircuitPython 8.1 (mid-2023), it is also possible to
create a <code>safemode.py</code> file that defines the custom behavior after a crash when
it is caused by something other than my code.</p>
<p>One of the prototype boards had PWM issues caused by pin collisions. According
to the
<a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RP2040 documentation</a>,
section <code>4.5.2. Programmer's Model</code>, there are eight 2-channel PWM slices. You
can't reliably use pins 0 and 16 at the same time. The same goes for pins 1 and
17, 8 and 18, and so on. I couldn't fix it in software, so I had to change the
PCB layout.</p>
<h3>Memory optimizations</h3>
<p>The entire program is more than 1000 lines long, and it's difficult to keep
everything in a single file. On the other hand, hardware modules depend on each
other more than ever, and code splitting would result in an increased memory
usage and cyclic import issues. I have created a few unit tests for partial
actions, so I had to have at least two modules to make tests run in the CPython
interpreter. The entire menu has been moved to a separate file as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on-device bytecode generation greatly increases the startup time.
Thankfully, there is a <code>mpy-cross</code> utility, used by Adafruit developers
themselves, that can do this ahead of time to mitigate this.</p>
