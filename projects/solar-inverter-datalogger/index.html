</section>  <section><h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>The application is hosted on the lowest-end ARM64 Raspberry Pi I could buy at
the moment (July 2023), the Model 3A+ with 512MB of RAM. It seems to be enough
for a dockerized web application. The SD card is the biggest bottleneck, so an
effort has been made to reduce writes and reads as much as possible. I have set
up the ZRAM because the CPU is idle most of the time. The <code>swappiness</code> parameter
is lowered as well. Logging was <strong>not</strong> disabled, in fact, I have configured
containers to use <code>journald</code> logging driver and preserve logs between restarts.</p>
<h3>Software internals</h3>
<p>The entire deployment consists of the API service, the frontend service, two
workers, the MQTT broker and the PostgreSQL database. Python and JavaScript
dependencies and Docker images have fixed versions specified, with security
issues automatically reported to me by GitHub. Prebuilt images are not
available; the entire application is built on the target device, using
multi-stage builds whenever possible.</p>
<p>The frontend service uses carefully chosen import statements to greatly reduce
tree-shaking time (from about an hour down to just a minute). Generated output
files are compressed and then hosted by nginx, with no further server-side
operations required.</p>
<p>There are two worker processes: <em>communicator</em> and <em>transformer</em>. The
communicator is responsible for retrieving data from the inverter,
post-processing, saving to the database, and sending to the MQTT broker. It can
change inverter settings as well. The transformer will periodically aggregate
raw data, store it in one of four tables (each tier has a different precision
and retention period), and remove old entries. These operations are performed
using raw SQL queries, with the help of PostgreSQL features such as date binning
and statistical mode.</p>
<h3>User experience</h3>
<p>Collected information can be accessed using a MQTT client (live parameters, in
read-only mode) or the mobile-friendly web interface. There are five screens:
live parameters (backed by MQTT over WebSocket), charts, energy production and
consumption, log entries and automation settings.</p>
<p>I've designed custom Bootstrap components to improve navigation. Favorite
parameters are saved in the browser's local storage. Log entries can be filtered
by their source: inverter errors, automations, and so on.</p>
<p>Charts are the most complex component of the web interface. Users can retrieve
data for two numeric parameters at once. I've used native date/time pickers and
added range presets for the convenience. API service is responsible for choosing
a tiered table that offers the best precision, and for reducing the number of
data points if necessary.</p>
<h3>Operating system choices</h3>
<p>Back in July 2023, Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian 12 was not available yet, so
I've decided to install <em>real</em> Debian with a mainline kernel in UEFI mode,
following the instructions from the
<a href="https://pete.akeo.ie/2019/07/installing-debian-arm64-on-raspberry-pi.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pete Batard's blog</a>
(Rufus author). For compatibility reasons, this solution uses a FAT16 EFI
partition instead of the more common FAT32, and it made the installation process
quite annoying. I had to open <code>fdisk</code> multiple times to change the partition's
signature.</p>
<p>In the following months, there were no stability issues, even after multiple
power outages. Basic features like Wi-Fi communication and power management
seemed to be fully supported. I've run into some issues I couldn't resolve,
though. Without an I2C or SPI support, you can't really add battery backup
because it's impossible to read its parameters. The <code>gpu_mem</code> setting was
ignored, so about 64MB of RAM went unused.</p>
<p>I've switched to the official operating system during monthly maintenance in
early 2024. Raspberry Pi Imager was used to prepare an SD card, customize
hostname and login credentials, and enable SSH â€“ no peripherals were
required. The database is stored in the <code>/var/lib/solar</code> directory, so it could
be compressed and copied over SSH easily. I've installed Docker, enabled
firewall (including SSH and HTTPS ports), started the Compose-based application
for the first time, and that was it.</p>
