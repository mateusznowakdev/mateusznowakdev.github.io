  <h1>Creating static site generator</h1>

    <p class="large">Back in 2022, I was asked for some help in setting up Jekyll site generator, which ended in creating quick alternative in Python. It's time to reuse it for my website</p>
    <p>Published on Mar 10, 2024</p>

  <section><p>Updating this very website has become cumbersome. Every time something is
changed, I need to generate a new set of images, update links at the bottom of
the page, check if the sitemap is correct, and perform other tasks. Thankfully,
I have found my old code and decided to retrofit it.</p>
<h2>Not just a plain text</h2>
<p>Long gone are the days when webpages were a collection of simple pages. My
website has the index page, the 404 page, projects, articles, external links, an
XML sitemap, and now there's also an Atom feed you can use with your favorite
news reader app. Projects and articles have banner images and short descriptions
shown on related pages.</p>
<p>Jekyll automatically finds <code>.md</code> files and uses a <em>front matter</em> section to
store metadata. I've decided to explicitly list all resources in the separate
configuration file. See the following code excerpt.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">name: Mateusz Nowak's personal website
author: Mateusz Nowak
url: https://mateusznowak.dev
pages:
  - url: /articles/manufacturing-pcb-at-home/
    title: Manufacturing PCBs at home
    description: ...
    banner_id: article-manufacturing-pcb-at-home
    type: article
    date: 2024-02-04T00:00:00+01:00
    sitemap: true
  - ...
</code></pre>
<p>Each resource is expected to have its own directory, with at least one file
named <code>index.md</code>, but it's not mandatory. If the file is missing, the resource
is considered external, and it can still be rendered properly.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean a front matter is not used at all. There are some elements that
can't be represented as plain Markdown, such as the action button or highlights
of a project. That's where front matter really shines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">github_url: https://github.com/mateusznowakdev/solar
features:
  - title: Live parameters
    description: ...
    banner_id: live-parameters
    banner_gravity: start
  - ...
stack:
  - Django REST
  - PostgreSQL
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, the YAML input is converted to Python dataclasses, which provides
basic validation. It's not possible to add properties that would go unused.</p>
<h2>Text to HTML</h2>
<p>There are multiple Markdown-to-HTML generators available for Python, but the
best I've found is <a href="https://mistune.lepture.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mistune</a>. It's fast, and it
fully supports <a href="https://prettier.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prettier</a>'s code style. Unfortunately, it
uses string concatenation to create output HTML, so you have to copy the entire
implementation of a function to introduce your changes.</p>
<p>The default output can be used as-is, but there were some SEO and performance
changes I wanted to introduce. Based on my knowledge, links should have <code>rel</code>
and <code>target</code> attributes, and images should be loaded lazily and scaled down to
save bandwidth.</p>
<p>There are some other operations that may be possible with Mistune, including
extracting the list of images, but for simplicityâ€™s sake, I've decided to use
regular expressions in this case.</p>
<h2>Images to smaller images</h2>
<p>Google recommends using WEBP images, but usually, the screenshots are created in
PNG format, while photos are JPG files. I can use GIMP or ImageMagick to convert
images manually, but I would rather automate it. If there is a JPG or PNG file
in the input directory, and the WEBP variant is used, then the additional
conversion should be performed.</p>
<p>For image scaling in Python, you can either use the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pillow library</a>, or ImageMagick bindings such
as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Wand/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wand</a>. Surprisingly, Pillow is faster and
requires you to add less code. It does not have the <code>gravity</code> option of
ImageMagick, but that can be implemented easily.</p>
<h2>HTML to... HTML</h2>
<p>The design of my website is simple enough, so splitting it into multiple smaller
templates was an easy task. There are also XML templates for the sitemap and
Atom feed. I'm using the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jinja template engine</a>, which is similar to
Django's engine (oh, I wish I wouldn't have to do templates for living in
2024...) but more forgiving.</p>
<h2>And that's it!</h2>
<p>With only 300 lines of Python code (<em>and, um, some external libraries,
templates, and other stuff</em>), it is possible to create a fully functional
website that looks great and is easy to extend and update!</p>
<p>I've
<a href="https://github.com/mateusznowakdev/static-site-generator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">uploaded the code to GitHub</a>,
but IMO it's too simple to be called a standalone project.</p>
