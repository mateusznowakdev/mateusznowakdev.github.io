    <p class="large">I have bought a CNC router to iterate on electronic designs even faster. Here's what hardware and software I use, and how to mill, drill and cut the board at home</p>

  <section><h2>A word on PCB fabs</h2>
<p>This is a viable solution, but only if you are 100% sure your design is what you
want. You get all the basic features, such as a soldermask, silkscreen, plated
vias and multiple layers. The price is so low that there is no risk of taxes
related to the value of the package. PCB fabs can also offer extra services,
such as an extended validity check or board assembly.</p>
<p>However, milling at home is better if you can't wait more than a week for
delivery of the board, but at the same time, you are unable to test the circuit
on the breadboard. Shipping options from China are limited (no delivery to
parcel lockers), and usually you have to order at least 5 boards you may find no
purpose for.</p>
<h2>My workflow</h2>
<p>I was looking for a simple, portable CNC device with basic safety features such
as a height probe (Z probe) and limit switches. I have found a used
<a href="https://www.sainsmart.com/products/genmitsu-3018-prover-v2-upgraded-semi-assembled-cnc-router-kit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SainSmart 3018-PROVer V2</a>
online. The router had a scratched spoilboard and the package was incomplete
(missing a single clamp and the entire set of V-bits). But hey, the entire thing
was inexpensive, and it works fine so far, despite some skill issues on my end.</p>
<p>The downside of the device is the noise it emits. If you set the spindle speed
to more than 1000 RPM, the vibrations become so annoying that you have to
do some soundproofing – I've made a simple enclosure out of a sheet of OSB
and some drywall. I'm also slightly disappointed with the Z axis precision. The
Y axis guiderails and the spindle mount do bend a little, and all inaccuracies
add up.</p>
<p></p><figure><a href="cnc-overview.webp"><img src="cnc-overview-w1024.webp" alt="CNC overview" srcset="cnc-overview-w1024.webp, cnc-overview.webp 2x" loading="lazy" /></a></figure><p></p>
<p>KiCAD is my PCB design software of choice. It's open source, and it works on
Linux<sup>[1]</sup> (available on Flathub). It might be annoying to use, but it's better
than paying for <del>EAGLE</del> Fusion 360 or trying to work around the limitations of
its non-commercial version. It's easy to create new symbols and footprints, but
usually you'll find them in the built-in library or online. There are 3D models
for select components as well. Finally, you can run batch tasks using the Python
scripting console.</p>
<p>People often recommend FlatCAM to postprocess Gerber/Excellon files, and Candle
to control the router. These are, in my honest opinion, the worst choices.
FlatCAM has an overcomplicated user interface that is changed on every single
release, so all video tutorials become useless in no time. Parameter options
conflict with each other, and there are no basic optimization features such as
milling path reduction or a reasonable drilling order. Candle's UI does not fit
on a smaller screen, auto-leveling seems not to work properly, and you can't run
this app on modern Linux distros even in Xorg mode. I've used a Windows virtual
machine to work around these issues, but eventually, I switched to
<a href="https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pcb2gcode</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Universal Gcode Sender (UGS)</a>.</p>
<p><sup>[1]</sup> It works, but there are huge performance issues on Wayland if there is at
least one maximized KiCAD window. You need to open the <code>dconf-editor</code>, set
<code>org.gnome.mutter.auto-maximize</code> to <code>false</code>, and then manually resize KiCAD
windows to the maximum possible size.</p>
<h2>KiCAD PCB parameters</h2>
<p>Initially, I wasn't using fine V-bits because I was afraid that they would break
or wear down easily, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>I prefer to mill PCBs with a 0.2 mm 45° V-bit (which is effectively
0.4 mm for the Z depth of 0.3 mm), cut the outline with a 1.5 mm
bit, and drill holes with a 1 mm drill. Some electric components, such as
high-current block terminals, may require a slightly larger drill.</p>
<p>You should set up board parameters in the <code>File &gt; Board Setup &gt; Design Rules</code>
menu right after you create a new KiCAD project. These values work for me, but I
haven't tried using any SOIC or QFP components in my designs yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Constraints<ul>
<li>Minimum clearance: 0.5 mm</li>
<li>Minimum track width: 0.5 mm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Net Classes<ul>
<li>&quot;Default&quot;<ul>
<li>Clearance: 0.5 mm</li>
<li>Track width: 0.77 mm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Large&quot; (add new)<ul>
<li>Clearance: 0.5 mm</li>
<li>Track width: 2.04 mm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p><figure><a href="kicad-design-rules.webp"><img src="kicad-design-rules-w1024.webp" alt="KiCAD Design rules" srcset="kicad-design-rules-w1024.webp, kicad-design-rules.webp 2x" loading="lazy" /></a></figure><p></p>
<p>Observe that 0.77 + 0.5 = 1.27 and 2.04 + 0.5 = 2.54. Common pin headers have
0.1 inch (2.54 mm) spacing. The values I've picked make routing
easier, but having parallel routes close to each other may be a bad idea for an
analog signal.</p>
<p>It's a good practice to set an unused area as a ground zone. It's quite
difficult in this case because there is only one layer, the bottom one. However,
you can draw on the top layer to pass the DRC (design rules check), then add
jumper wires where it is necessary. Make sure removing islands (unconnected
ground planes) is disabled.</p>
<p></p><figure><a href="kicad-copper-zone-properties.webp"><img src="kicad-copper-zone-properties-w1024.webp" alt="KiCAD Copper zone properties" srcset="kicad-copper-zone-properties-w1024.webp, kicad-copper-zone-properties.webp 2x" loading="lazy" /></a></figure><p></p>
<p>Finally, it may be useful to enlarge pads to make the soldering easier. It is
possible to change their size and shape. The maximum valid area is 2.04 mm
× 2.04 mm (based on the design rules), but rectangular pads are
difficult to work with due to the lack of a soldermask. I would recommend having
these oval or circular.</p>
<p>Both changes can be performed manually, but you can use the scripting console
(KiPython) as well. This is an experimental feature, so remember to save your
changes before running any code, or you may lose progress when KiCAD crashes.
Open the console, copy the following code, and paste it with Ctrl+Shift+V.</p>
<p><strong>This code was tested with KiCAD 7.0.8.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pcbnew

board = pcbnew.GetBoard()

for p in board.GetPads():
    if p.GetNetname():  # pads without name are just holes
        p.SetSize(pcbnew.VECTOR2I(2040000, 2040000))  # nanometers
        p.SetDrillSize(pcbnew.VECTOR2I(1000000, 1000000))
        p.SetShape(2)  # OVAL

pcbnew.Refresh()
</code></pre>
<h2>KiCAD export</h2>
<p>The default (0, 0) point is in the top-left corner of the PCB drawing sheet. It
has to be moved to the top-left corner of the actual PCB, or you will run into
issues after you send the job to the router. Select the <code>Place origin point</code> and
<code>Set the grid origin point</code> (long press) options from the toolbar, and use them
to match the result shown in the picture below.</p>
<p></p><figure><a href="kicad-origin-points.webp"><img src="kicad-origin-points-w1024.webp" alt="KiCAD Origin points" srcset="kicad-origin-points-w1024.webp, kicad-origin-points.webp 2x" loading="lazy" /></a></figure><p></p>
<p>Gerber files (for milling and cutting) and Excellon files (for drilling) can be
exported from the <code>File &gt; Plot</code> menu. Make sure the option to respect custom
drill/place origins is enabled and that both PTH and NPTH holes are exported to
a single file. If you have oval mounting holes in your PCB design, select
alternate drill mode, otherwise such holes will be ignored when generating
G-code.</p>
<h2>Postprocessing</h2>
<p>I've already mentioned that <code>pcb2gcode</code> is the software I use to further process
the KiCAD's output. You can update G-code files with just a single command once
you adjust the parameters to match your router's capabilities.</p>
<p>First, the program itself needs to be compiled from source. I'm using the Docker
container to install the dependencies, based on the following <code>Dockerfile</code>.
There is an extra user with UID 1000 created to avoid the permission issues.
Furthermore, I remove the output SVG files as soon as they are generated (I
couldn't find the option to disable this behavior).</p>
<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM debian:11

RUN apt-get update \
    &amp;&amp; apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf autoconf-archive libtool libboost-program-options-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev gerbv git librsvg2-dev -y

RUN git clone https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode.git \
    &amp;&amp; cd pcb2gcode \
    &amp;&amp; git checkout v2.5.0 \
    &amp;&amp; autoreconf -fvi \
    &amp;&amp; ./configure \
    &amp;&amp; make \
    &amp;&amp; make install

RUN useradd -u 1000 user
USER user

WORKDIR /output
ENTRYPOINT bash -c &quot;pcb2gcode &amp;&amp; rm *.svg&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Recent versions of Docker have the Compose plugin built in. Create a
<code>compose.yml</code> file and paste this YAML there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">services:
  main:
    build: .
    image: pcb2gcode:2.5.0
    volumes:
      - ./project/output:/output
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run the <code>pcb2gcode</code> with <code>docker compose up</code>.</p>
<p>However, it won't do anything useful without the <code>millproject</code> configuration
file. There are some non-standard settings enabled, such as disabling
unsupported commands (<code>nog64</code>, <code>nog81</code>, <code>nom6</code>), removing empty areas
(<code>voronoi</code>), and adding supports when cutting the outline (<code>bridges</code>). I've
tried to make the entire manufacturing process as non-disruptive as possible.
Consult the program's documentation for more information and suggestions.</p>

<h2>Milling the PCB</h2>
<p><strong>WARNING: I take no responsibility for any damage to your health or property.</strong></p>
<p>It's time to finally turn the copper-clad laminate into a useful circuit board.
Secure it onto the spoilboard and make sure that the spindle would be able to
move freely in the Z axis. Use double-sided tape for larger or thinner boards if
necessary. Insert the milling bit and then attach the Z probe (you may have to
modify it and add the second alligator clip).</p>
<p>Open the Universal Gcode Sender (UGS), connect to the router, and move the
spindle to the top-right corner of the usable area. Lower the spindle until the
probe's LED turns red. Click <code>Reset Zero</code> and then <code>Return to Zero</code> to make sure
the router is calibrated.</p>
<p></p><figure><a href="ugs-autoleveler.webp"><img src="ugs-autoleveler-w1024.webp" alt="UGS Autoleveler" srcset="ugs-autoleveler-w1024.webp, ugs-autoleveler.webp 2x" loading="lazy" /></a></figure><p></p>
<p><strong>Auto-leveling</strong>: Load the bottom layer file and open the AutoLeveler plugin
(<code>Window &gt; Plugins &gt; AutoLeveler</code>). Click <code>Use loaded file</code> to resize the height
map. Change the Z axis range to -2 mm to 2 mm. The resolution of about
10 mm should be fine. Start the AutoLeveler and wait for the scanning to be
completed. Save the height map for later, it will be useful if UGS crashes.
Disconnect the height probe and click <code>Return to Zero</code>. <strong>Do not run
AutoLeveler</strong> again once you have milled the board, it will not work because
copper areas are not connected anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Milling</strong>: Make sure bottom layer file is loaded and the AutoLeveler's
<code>Apply to Gcode</code> option is checked. Click <code>Send</code> (the &quot;play&quot; button). The
spindle will move up a little. Click <code>Send</code> again to actually start the milling.
<code>Return to Zero</code> once the job is done. Inspect the board; it may be necessary to
run the process again if some tracks look incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting</strong>: Press the emergency button, raise the spindle, insert a new bit,
lower the spindle to make it barely touch the board, then release (rotate) the
button. Open the outline file and repeat the steps above.</p>
<p><strong>Drilling</strong>: Repeat the steps above.</p>

<p>At last, detach the PCB from the spoilboard. Use some coarse sandpaper to finish
the edges of the PCB if necessary, expand the mounting holes using a power
drill, and install all electronic components according to the schematic. Use
extra flux to make soldering easier.</p>
<p></p><figure><a href="cnc-finished.webp"><img src="cnc-finished-w1024.webp" alt="Finished and cleaned board" srcset="cnc-finished-w1024.webp, cnc-finished.webp 2x" loading="lazy" /></a></figure><p></p>
<h2>Soldermask</h2>
<p>There are two methods of applying a UV-curable soldermask to the PCB. First, you
can add a few drops of such resin onto the finished board, use a thin film and a
sharpie pen to mask solder points, expose the resin, and then remove the
remaining resin with isopropyl alcohol. This may be the more annoying option
because you have to guess how long the board has to be exposed, and the uncured
soldermask will get stuck in drilled holes.</p>
<p>Another approach is to drip some resin onto the board right after milling, then
remove it mechanically. This option has some disadvantages when paired with my
CNC router. The copper layer is really thin, and you will either damage PCB
traces or skip some solder points. A 10×10 cm board is far too large. It
may work fine for smaller PCBs, though.</p>
<p>I think that it's not worth it. I've spent some time and money, and it didn't
work well. If you really need a soldermask, then make a prototype, test it, and
then order PCBs online. Remember that a soldermask is not an insulation layer,
and it is only used to make soldering easier and to protect the board from
oxidation.</p>
<h2>Random tips and tricks</h2>
<p>Start with some smaller designs if this is your first time milling PCBs. Make
sure to understand basic concepts, such as homing the device. If you consider
yourself more experienced, remember that mistakes may happen anyway.</p>
<p>Be aware that your CNC router is a relatively cheap device, and it may be
counterintuitive in use. Try out various feed rates and spindle speeds and find
the best values for reduced noise and vibrations and prolonged device life. My
CNC router's spindle can reach crazy fast speeds, but in practice, 1500 RPM
is good enough.</p>
<p>Try out different base materials and know the difference between them. FR4 and
CEM3 are the most popular ones, and they can be used to make rigid PCBs, but you
can't cut them easily. I prefer the phenolic paper laminate, which I believe is
also known as FR1/FR2. Its structure is softer, similar to the common perfboard,
and the boards I buy seem to have a thin protective layer.</p>
<p>Learn the basics of G-code. It's possible to move the spindle manually with a
knob, but the router will not know about this change. If you run G-code
commands, then the internal device state is updated, and UGS actions such as
<code>Return to Zero</code> can work properly. You should know how <code>G0</code>, <code>G90/G91</code> and
<code>M3/M4/M5</code> can be used, and how to modify <code>.ngc</code> files to skip commands. I have
found <a href="https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">good G-code documentation</a> online to
help you get started.</p>
